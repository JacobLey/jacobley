# Hello! My name is Jacob Ley

If you are looking for documentation about this monorepo, [see here](./root/jacobley/).

I am primarily a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) developer, with a love for open source!

I primarily focus on developer experience with fully typed ESM, but am constantly trying out new technologies.

Most of my personally owned projects are hosted within this monorepo, but also see other projects I have helped maintained:

* [Express OpenAPI Validator](https://github.com/cdimascio/express-openapi-validator)
