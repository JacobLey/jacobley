/**
 * Higher order function that allows patching a method.
 * Only necessary for named function exports (e.g. not attached to a class or object).
 *
 * Because function is exported directly, any usage of "this" must be bound or passed explicitly.
 *
 * Patching a method should only be done in for purposes of testing.
 *
 * Different patches of the same method will yield the same patch! This is important as exporting a patched
 * method can be tricky (typescript reference errors) so "recalculating" the patch works just as well.
 * Useful for cases of patching a third party module that only exports a method.
 *
 * Patches are also idempotent. Re-patching a method (although probably an anti-pattern) will result in the
 * original patched method.
 *
 * @example
 * import { patch, patchKey } from 'named-patch';
 * import { stub } from 'sinon';
 *
 * const originalFunction = (x, y) => x + y;
 * const patched = patch(originalFunction);
 * patched(1,2) === 3; // true
 * stub(patched, patchKey).callsFake(() => 4);
 * patched(1,2) === 4; // true
 *
 * patch(originalFunction) === patched; // true;
 * patch(patched) === patched; // true;
 *
 * @param {Function} fn - Method to patch.
 * @returns {Function} Method with same signature as input, but patchable.
