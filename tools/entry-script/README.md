## Introduction

Modular control for entry script execution.

Many top-level NodeJS executables look something like:

```ts
// bin.ts
import express from 'express.js';
import { database } from './my-database.js';
import { middleware } from './my-middleware.js';

await database.connect();

const app = express();
app.use(middleware);

app.listen(3000);
```

This file is not testable, extendable, or modular because it executes the moment it is loaded. It is not possible to stub methods like `database.connect` in a test suite.

`entry-script` solves this by providing a light class to extend and export as default. The internals of `EntryScript` detect that the class is the top-level script, and kicks off the process.

But during a test environment where it is _not_ the top-level script, nothing is executed! That allows you to mock and inspect methods as necessary to fully test your code.

## Install

```sh
npm i entry-script
```

<a name="Example"></a>
## Example

```ts
// my-app.ts
import { EntryScript, runtimeError } from 'entry-script';
import express from 'express';
import { database } from './my-database.js';
import { middleware } from './my-middleware.js';

/**
 * All method overrides are optional!
 * Only fill in what you need
 */
export default MyApp extends EntryScript {

    /**
     * Override this method to provide async setup/loading logic
     */
    public static async create() {
        await database.connect();
        return new MyApp(process.env.PORT);
    }

    /**
     * Attach any custom parameters to instance
     */
    constructor(port) {
        super();
        this.port = port;

        // Handle uncaught errors
        this.on(runtimeError, () => {
            process.exitCode = 1;
        });
    }

    /**
     * Override this method for core app logic.
     */
    public async start() {
        const app = express();
        app.use(middleware);

        app.listen(this.port);

        // Also an event emitter!
        this.emit('Listening!', this.port);

        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // Graceful shutdown
            process.once('SIGTERM', () => {
                resolve();
            });
        });
    }

    /**
     * Override this method to perform any cleanup logic, regardless if `start` threw an error.
     */
    public async finish() {
        await database.disconnect();
    }
}
```

Now executing `node ./my-app.js` will start the server as expected!

But `import MyApp from './my-app.js';` will return the app class that is ripe for unit/integration testing!

## Usage

`entry-script` is an ESM module. That means it _must_ be `import`ed. To load from a CJS module, use dynamic import `const { EntryScript } = await import('entry-script');`.

Any class that extends `EntryScript` must export itself as the `default` export.

The `EntryScript` itself extends [StaticEmitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-emitter) for event emitting convenience.

## API

### EntryScript

Extendable class that control logic flow of an entry point. Will not perform any execution if the entry point for nodejs does not export a child class of EntryScript as `default`.

#### Methods to override

Each method can call `super.<method>()` as desired, but the base methods are very basic, often NOOP, logic.

##### create

Async static method.

Perform any "pre-execution" logic here, such as loading configs or connecting to databases.

Must return an instance of the class, either by calling `return new MyClass()` directly, or `return super.create()`.

##### constructor

Normal class constructor.

Customize the properties of the class as appropriate.

##### start

Async instance method.

Perform most of the business logic here. Once this promise resolves, cleanup will be initialized.

So long-running tasks like servers should return a dangling promise, one that is perhaps only resolved on signal interrupts.

##### finish

Async instance method.

Perform any "post-execution" logic here, such as disconnecting from databases, or writing final data to disk.

This will be called regardless of the "success" of the `start` script.

### runtimeError

Symbol that will be used as event key on the `EntryScript` instance whenever `start` throws an error.

Listening on this event is optional, but recommended for handling unexpected cleanup, or taking options such as setting a failing exit code.
